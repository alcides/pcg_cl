---------------------------------------------------------

This package includes both the MWC64X and the PCG random number generator for OpenCL.

You can read more about MWC64X in the README_MWC64X.txt file.
For more information about PCG you should head to http://www.pcg-random.org.


Inside the test directory, you have some examples of using both approaches. In order to execute them, you should change the top lines of the makefile.
